# Chair of Software Engineering II at the University of Passau, Germany

Prof. Dr. Gordon Fraser leads the Chair of Software Engineering II
at the Faculty of Computer Science and Mathematics
at the University of Passau, Germany.
We provide our research projects within this organisation.

The central theme of our research is improving software quality,
and our recent research concerns the prevention,
detection,
and removal of defects in software.
More specifically,
we develop techniques to generate test cases automatically,
and to guide the tester in validating the output of tests
by producing test oracles and specifications.
